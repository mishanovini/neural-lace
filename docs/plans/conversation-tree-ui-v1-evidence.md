# Evidence Log — Conversation Tree UI v1

Companion evidence file for `docs/plans/conversation-tree-ui-v1.md`. The plan
declares `rung: 2`, so tasks at or above R2 require a `## Comprehension
Articulation` block (per `~/.claude/rules/comprehension-gate.md`) before
`task-verifier` flips the checkbox.

---

## Task 0.1 — Walking Skeleton: file-mediated read/write spine

Code shipped as commit `952c9d6` (Phase 0 Walking Skeleton). The functional
spine was independently corroborated by task-verifier (1-node baseline → SSE
push → 2 nodes, no reload). This entry supplies the comprehension articulation
the rung-2 gate requires; no checkbox is flipped here.

## Comprehension Articulation

### Spec meaning

The Walking Skeleton has to prove, end-to-end and for real, the *passive
file-mediated tracker spine* that ADR-031 Option 2 commits the whole v1 to —
not a feature, just the load-bearing data path. Concretely: a writer mutates a
single well-known JSON file whose shape carries a `schema_version` integer, an
append-only `events` array, and a `snapshot` that is *derived* (reduced) from
those events rather than independently authored. A separate Node process,
using only the standard library (no framework, no build step, no new runtime
dep), serves the static page and exposes the current snapshot — it only ever
*reads* the file; it never writes state and never spawns or steers a Claude
Code session. A vanilla browser page renders exactly one visual node per
`branch-opened` event. The skeleton must demonstrate liveness: appending a
second event makes the page go from one node to two with no manual reload,
pushed to the browser. ADR-031 r7 Pin 3b is the hard correctness requirement —
a state mutation must publish as a *single atomic step* so any concurrent
reader of the well-known path sees either the pre-mutation file or the
post-mutation file in whole, never a half-written event. Everything binds to
localhost only (NFR-5). The state shape is deliberately *forward-shaped*
toward ADR-032 but the full event-type enum / node layout is explicitly NOT
pre-built — Phase 0 ships exactly one event type and the minimal reducer for
it.

### Edge cases covered

- **Atomic publish (Pin 3b).** Every mutation writes to a unique temp path
  then `renameSync`s it over the well-known file in one step:
  `state/state.js:77` builds `STATE_FILE + '.tmp.' + process.pid + '.' +
  Date.now()`, `state/state.js:78` writes the whole serialized state to that
  temp, and `state/state.js:79` `fs.renameSync(tmp, STATE_FILE)` performs the
  single atomic publish. The whole file (events + recomputed snapshot) is
  replaced in one rename, so a reader never observes a torn append.
- **Server survives the inode swap.** Because write-temp-then-rename replaces
  the file's inode, watching the file directly would stop firing after the
  first rename. The server instead watches the *directory* and filters on the
  basename: `server/server.js:45` computes `stateBase =
  path.basename(STATE_FILE)`, `server/server.js:46` calls
  `fs.watch(path.dirname(STATE_FILE), ...)`, and `server/server.js:47`
  filters `if (filename && filename !== stateBase) return;` — so the watcher
  keeps firing across every atomic-rename swap. The rename's
  create/rename event pair is coalesced by a 40 ms debounce at
  `server/server.js:48-49`.
- **Missing / torn state file read fallback.** `state/state.js:39-45`
  catches read/parse failure: `ENOENT` returns a fresh `emptyState()` at
  `state/state.js:40` (first-run, no file yet), and any other parse failure
  writes a diagnostic to stderr at `state/state.js:43` and returns
  `emptyState()` at `state/state.js:44` — surfaced, not silently swallowed.
  A non-numeric `schema_version` is also treated as empty at
  `state/state.js:37`.
- **SSE initial-frame-on-connect vs push-on-change.** On a new SSE
  connection the server immediately pushes the current snapshot:
  `server/server.js:80` calls `sendState(res)` right after adding the client
  at `server/server.js:79`, so a freshly loaded page renders the existing
  state without waiting for a mutation. Subsequent changes are pushed via
  `broadcastState()` (`server/server.js:35-39`) driven by the directory
  watcher. The client treats a zero-node snapshot as the empty state
  (`web/app.js:17-20`) rather than rendering nothing ambiguous.

### Edge cases NOT covered

- **Torn-snapshot recovery by log replay (Pin 3a).** Phase 0 deliberately
  degrades a corrupt/torn file to `emptyState()` (`state/state.js:41-44`
  comment says so explicitly). Real recovery — replaying the append-only log
  to rebuild the snapshot — is Phase A work, not in this skeleton. Correctly
  deferred: Pin 3a recovery depends on the ADR-032 schema field layout which
  does not exist yet.
- **Multi-project + global-tree path resolution.** The well-known path is a
  single global file fixed at `state/state.js:24-25` (`STATE_DIR =
  __dirname`, `tree-state.json`). Per-project and global-tree resolution
  (FR-18 / FR-25) is owned by ADR-032 / Phase A and explicitly flagged
  not-decided-here in the `state/state.js:22-23` comment. Correctly deferred.
- **Event types beyond `branch-opened`.** The reducer at
  `state/state.js:49-62` handles exactly one event type; the full enum
  (decision-raised, question-raised, answered, action-added, concluded,
  re-opened, archived, …) is ADR-032's. A non-`branch-opened` event is
  silently ignored by the reducer loop — acceptable for Phase 0 because no
  other type is emitted yet; the full reduction is Phase A.
- **Enforcement substrate.** No PreToolUse / Stop gate, no Pattern rule, no
  hook wiring exists in this commit — the server is a pure passive reader
  (`server/server.js:11-12`). Enforcement (`conversation-tree-state-gate.sh`,
  the Stop gate, the Pattern rule) is Phase B; the skeleton intentionally
  proves only the read/write data path.
- **Concurrent-writer correctness / NFR-2.** Phase 0 has a single writer
  (the CLI seed entrypoint at `state/state.js:87-98`). True concurrent
  GUI-append + Dispatch-append conflict resolution (NFR-2 conflict-unit) is
  ADR-032 / Phase A; this skeleton does not exercise two simultaneous
  writers.

### Assumptions

- **Same-filesystem `rename()` atomicity.** The Pin-3b guarantee at
  `state/state.js:79` holds only because the temp file
  (`state/state.js:77`, built from `STATE_FILE + '.tmp...'`) lives in the
  *same directory* as `STATE_FILE` (`state/state.js:24-25`), so the rename is
  same-filesystem and POSIX-atomic. A cross-filesystem temp would make
  `renameSync` a non-atomic copy+unlink; the code structurally avoids that by
  deriving the temp path from `STATE_FILE` itself.
- **Single writer for Phase 0.** Correctness of the read-modify-write in
  `appendBranchOpened` (`state/state.js:65-81`: `readState()` →
  `events.push` → `deriveSnapshot` → atomic publish) assumes no second writer
  interleaves between the read at `state/state.js:67` and the rename at
  `state/state.js:79`. Phase 0 only has the single CLI seed writer
  (`state/state.js:87-98`), so this holds; multi-writer is explicitly
  Phase A.
- **Localhost-only trust.** The server does no auth and serves arbitrary
  `web/` assets via `serveStatic` (`server/server.js:52-59`). Safe only
  because it binds `127.0.0.1` (`server/server.js:21`, `HOST = '127.0.0.1'`,
  passed to `server.listen` at `server/server.js:89`) per NFR-5 — a
  non-localhost bind would expose an unauthenticated file server.
- **Browser `EventSource` support.** Liveness depends entirely on the
  client's `new EventSource('/api/events')` at `web/app.js:44`; there is no
  polling fallback. Assumes a modern browser with native SSE support
  (true for the single-user localhost target).
- **Directory watch fires on rename.** The push-on-change path assumes
  `fs.watch` on the directory (`server/server.js:46`) emits an event whose
  `filename` equals the basename when the atomic rename lands. The 40 ms
  debounce at `server/server.js:48-49` assumes the create/rename pair arrives
  within that window so it coalesces to one `broadcastState`. Both hold on
  the local OS the single-user tracker runs on; cross-platform fs.watch
  quirks are out of Phase-0 scope.

## Task A1 — ADR-032 state-schema contract

Authored docs/decisions/032-conversation-tree-state-schema.md (the Tier-4 JSON tree-state field-layout contract every later phase consumes) + the docs/DECISIONS.md index row. Verification: contract — reviewer = systems-designer (Tier-4 contract review), dispatched by the orchestrator after this build.

## Comprehension Articulation

### Spec meaning

Task A1 freezes ONLY the state-file field layout + the NFR-2 conflict-unit; the three Pin-3 viability properties (torn-snapshot recovery, single-event-atomic append, compaction trigger) and the Pin-2 unknown-major refuse are FIXED inputs from ADR-031 r7 that I restate as constraints and express as concrete fields, never re-decide. The ADR must formalize+extend the Phase-0 skeleton's exact shape (int schema_version, append-only events, derived snapshot, atomic renameSync publish) — not contradict it — and must make the most semantically-meaningful enforcement property (Pin 1: an entry naming branch X exists) reduce to a single jq key-presence check against the append-only events array, with the branch name supplied independently by the spawn tool_input so the bar is non-gameable.

### Edge cases covered

FR-2 conversational-divergence cardinality is encoded structurally by putting items ON a node (node.items[]) not as nodes, with the explicit N=3 fixture (docs/decisions/032-...md §3: 3 items same node_id ⇒ 0 extra branch-opened ⇒ 0 extra branches; divergence ⇒ exactly 1 branch-opened; per-item split opt-in only via `promoted`). Torn snapshot ⇒ §7a coverage-marker (snapshot.valid + covers_through_event_id) forces event-log replay. Unknown major ⇒ §1 distinct "schema too new — upgrade" refuse, never mis-parse (Pin 2). Concurrent GUI+Dispatch write ⇒ §6 conflict-unit = single event record, union-by-event_id, reducer-invariant rejection (nothing silently dropped — NFR-2 safety). Cross-tree FR-3 ⇒ §5 qualified `<tree_id>::<node_id>` cross_links, zero multi-parenting (FR-1 strict-tree preserved). Compaction across "a minute or a month" ⇒ §7c truncates only the provably-covered log prefix; audit log never truncated. concluded-with-unchecked-item rejected by the reducer (FR-7 invariant, §2).

### Edge cases NOT covered

(1) Cross-file referential integrity for a foreign `tree_id::node_id` whose target was deleted — §5/Consequences explicitly accepts NFR-9 degrade (render + "unavailable" flag, never a crash) over hard FK enforcement, because cross-file FK at <100-branch scale is disproportionate; this is a stated accepted ceiling, not an unhandled gap. (2) A general adversarial multi-writer CRDT/OT merge — §6 explicitly scopes the mechanism to two cooperating writers per PRD out-of-scope; the general case is deliberately excluded, not missed. (3) Semantic correctness of the tree itself — §8 states honestly this is the documented ADR-031 ceiling (mechanical layer verifies branch-record presence only); semantic truth is the B3 rule-class + Misha's interrupt authority, by design not by omission. (4) A *major* schema change discovered during A2 — Consequences routes this to a schema_version bump + ADR revision, not a silent in-flight edit; that path is named, the change itself is future work.

### Assumptions

Assumes ADR-031 r7 is the binding accepted architecture and its 3 pins are inputs not subject to re-decision in A1 (verified: ADR Status ACCEPTED r7, pins folded @ 8275d31; restated as fixed in §1/§7/§8). Assumes the Phase-0 skeleton at 68d598e is forward-shaped toward this contract and its evolution to the §2/§3/§7 shapes is additive within major 1 (Phase 0 is pre-freeze, no consumer of the frozen contract exists yet, so the skeleton's `schema_version: 1` is unchanged — verified by reading state.js/server.js at the branch tip). Assumes `jq` is available to the Phase-B gates (consistent with every existing harness hook precedent — bug-persistence-gate.sh / teammate-spawn-validator.sh use jq). Assumes PRD OQ-1 genuinely delegated the conflict mechanism + conflict-unit to this ADR (verified: PRD OQ-1 "DEFERRED to ADR-032", NFR-2 carries only the safety property). Assumes the spawn `tool_input` supplies the branch identifier independently of the state file (ADR-031 r7 Pin 1 explicit — the non-gameability of §8 depends on it; B0 empirically re-verifies the tool_name-for-MCP sub-assumption before B1 relies on it).

## Task A2 — state library implementation

Builder: worker-A2 (plan-phase-builder discipline). Verification: full. Reviewers: code-reviewer + task-verifier.

Deliverable: the ADR-032 §1–§7 state library, evolving the Phase-0 skeleton ADDITIVELY within schema major 1. Files: `neural-lace/conversation-tree-ui/state/schema.js` (§1/§2 contract surface), `state/reducer.js` (§2/§3/§4/§6 deterministic fold + invariants), `state/store.js` (§5 path resolution + §7a/§7b/§7c + Pin-2 versioned read + NFR-1/NFR-7), `state/state.js` (public facade, Phase-0 API preserved), `state/selftest.js` (8-property suite), `state/.gitignore` (runtime artifacts), and in-scope reader-glue in `server/server.js` (SchemaTooNewError → distinct refuse, never a crash/mis-parse).

Self-test: `node neural-lace/conversation-tree-ui/state/selftest.js` → 8 passed, 0 failed: P1 atomic-append-under-simulated-crash, P2 torn-snapshot→deterministic-log-replay, P3 compaction-truncation-correctness+audit-never-truncated, P4 unknown-major-refused-distinct-message-nothing-read, P5 last-N-version-retention, P6 event_id-idempotency, P7 FR-2 N=3 fixture (3 items one thread ⇒ 0 extra branches; divergence ⇒ exactly 1), P8 strict-tree invariant (cycle rejected, event retained).

Regression: Phase-0 Walking-Skeleton 3-step PASS — `node state/state.js seed` produces a valid state file with Phase-0 compat node fields (`id`, `opened_at`); the unmodified Node server serves `/` (200) and `/api/state` (1 node); appending a 2nd `branch-opened` makes the served snapshot go 1→2 nodes via the unchanged `fs.watch`+SSE path with no reload. Unknown-major reader-glue verified: server stays up and serves `{"schema_too_new":true,"message":"schema too new — upgrade the GUI/gate"}` instead of crashing.

Runtime verification: test neural-lace/conversation-tree-ui/state/selftest.js::P1..P8 — `node neural-lace/conversation-tree-ui/state/selftest.js` exits 0, "8 passed, 0 failed", replayable.

## Comprehension Articulation

### Spec meaning
ADR-032 froze a JSON state-file field layout that EXPRESSES (does not re-decide) ADR-031 r7's three Pin-3 viability properties plus the Pin-2 unknown-major refuse. A2 implements the runtime library that writes/reads that exact layout: an append-only `events[]` (the source of truth, §2 envelope `event_id`/`type`/`ts`/`actor` + per-type required fields), a derived `snapshot` that is NEVER trusted without its §7a coverage marker (`snapshot.valid` + `snapshot.covers_through_event_id`), atomic single-event publish via write-temp-then-`renameSync` (§7b), compaction that truncates only the provably-covered log prefix while a separate append-only audit log is never truncated (§7c/NFR-7), and a versioned reader that refuses an unknown major with the exact string `schema too new — upgrade the GUI/gate`, reading nothing (§1/Pin-2). The reducer is the single deterministic definition of events→snapshot so torn-snapshot recovery reduces to "discard the cache, re-run the reducer." Schema major stays 1 because Phase 0 is pre-freeze and the field renames are expected shaping, not a contract break.

### Edge cases covered
Atomic append under a simulated crashed half-write — `store.js:appendEvent` writes a temp then `fs.renameSync` (`store.js` ~line 270), so a stray `.tmp` never becomes the well-known path (selftest P1, `selftest.js` P1 block). Torn snapshot via `valid:false`, stale `covers_through_event_id`, and absent snapshot — `store.js:readState` marker check (`store.js` ~line 150) discards and replays via `reducer.deriveSnapshot` (selftest P2). Compaction truncating only the covered prefix while the audit log survives — `store.js:appendEvent` compaction branch (`store.js` ~line 230) + `appendAudit`/`replayAuditLog` (selftest P3). Unknown major throwing `SchemaTooNewError` with the exact message and no payload — `store.js:readRawState` (`store.js` ~line 95) + `selftest.js` P4. Last-N retention via `rotateVersions` (`store.js` ~line 200, selftest P5). event_id idempotency — duplicate append is a no-op via `dedupeById` + the appendEvent guard (`store.js` ~line 180, selftest P6). FR-2 N=3 — items live on `node.items[]` not as nodes so 3 `*-raised`/`action-added` on one `node_id` ⇒ 0 extra branches (`reducer.js` `decision-raised`/`question-raised`/`action-added` cases ~line 80, selftest P7). FR-1 strict-tree — `reducer.js:wouldCycle` (`reducer.js` ~line 35) rejects a cycle-forming `re-parented` while the log retains the event (selftest P8).

### Edge cases NOT covered
Cross-tree FR-3 reference resolution across separate files (a `cross_links[].to` of form `tree_id::node_id`) is stored verbatim by the reducer but NOT resolved here — ADR-032 §5 explicitly defers cross-file resolution to GUI render time (Phase C/D); A2's scope is one tree-file's library. The FR-15 `bound_sessions[]` population path (`session-bound`/`session-unbound` events) is deliberately NOT added — the dispatch directive and the plan's `## In-flight scope updates` 2026-05-17 entry explicitly assign that additive closure to the Phase-C/D integration layer, not A2; the reducer leaves `bound_sessions: []` correctly empty. True multi-process concurrent-writer fuzzing (real OS-level interleaving of two `node` processes) is not exercised — selftest P1 simulates the torn-write structurally (renameSync atomicity is an OS guarantee, not re-tested); a general adversarial CRDT case is PRD-out-of-scope per ADR-032 §6. Compaction's "events strictly after covers_through_event_id" path is exercised only in the all-covered shape (post-compaction empty log + marker); a partial-prefix retention shape is correct by construction but not separately fixtured.

### Assumptions
`fs.renameSync` is atomic on a single filesystem (the Phase-0 skeleton's documented premise, ADR-032 §7b restates it as fixed — not re-verified here). Node ≥ the harness baseline is present (verified v24.13.1; only stdlib `fs`/`path`/`os` used — no new runtime dependency, per plan Assumptions). The Phase-0 well-known single-file path (`state/tree-state.json`) remains the DEFAULT so `server.js`'s `STATE_FILE` destructure and the `seed` CLI behave identically; the real §5 per-project/global resolver is opt-in via `opts.statePath`/`opts.treeId` (additive, no consumer break since no frozen-contract consumer exists yet — ADR-032 Consequences). The unmodified `web/app.js` reads `node.id`/`node.opened_at`; the reducer emits those as backward-compat alias fields alongside the canonical §3 `node_id` so the regression baseline holds without touching the client. `event_id` uniqueness within a file is sufficient for idempotency at NFR-3 <100-branch scale (ULID-shaped generator; collision probability negligible, not cryptographically asserted).

EVIDENCE BLOCK
==============
Task ID: A2
Task description: Implement the state library against ADR-032 (per-component sub-items A2a–A2e; each independently verified). — Verification: full — Reviewer: code-reviewer + task-verifier.
Verified at: 2026-05-17T00:00:00Z
Verifier: task-verifier agent (independent corroboration of three supplied upstream verdicts)

Comprehension-gate: PASS (confidence 8) — comprehension-reviewer rung-2 verdict SUPPLIED final by orchestrator (Task tool unavailable in sub-agents this env, Anthropic no-nested-subagents — documented orchestrator-mediated workaround). Three-stage rubric PASS: Stage 1 schema (four canonical `### ` sub-sections — Spec meaning / Edge cases covered / Edge cases NOT covered / Assumptions — present, ordered); Stage 2 substance (each task-specific to the A2 impl, well over threshold, no placeholder); Stage 3 diff-correspondence (every Edge-cases-covered citation resolves to a named construct in 2cf52de's state/*.js; no Assumption contradicted — renameSync atomicity, stdlib-only, Phase-0 default-path, alias fields, non-crypto ULID id positively confirmed). One non-blocking instance-only advisory (minor wording on WHO owns the deferred bound_sessions[] closure — gap correctly classified NOT-covered + diff-confirmed; no fix required). Verifier independently confirmed the articulation block is present and well-formed in this evidence file (lines 294–306). rung-2 comprehension-gate SATISFIED.

Verification level: full
Plan-mandated reviewers: code-reviewer + task-verifier

FUNCTIONALITY-OVER-COMPONENTS axis: PASS. The state library's "user" is the harness; per the plan's Testing Strategy and the FUNCTIONALITY-OVER-COMPONENTS rule, the self-test passing IS the user-facing functionality proof for this Verification: full task. The functionality signal (8/8 property self-test independently re-executed by the verifier this pass + the live Phase-0 3-step regression independently re-executed) is present alongside the component signals — not component-only.

Checks run:
1. Branch + commit confirmation
   Command: git log --oneline -5
   Output: 63c0a02 (NL-FINDING-003 persist), 2cf52de (Task A2 state library), 4164043 (A1 PASS), on branch claude/kind-faraday-c5fe05
   Result: PASS

2. A2 deliverable files present at 2cf52de and on disk
   Command: git show 2cf52de --stat -- neural-lace/conversation-tree-ui/ ; ls -la neural-lace/conversation-tree-ui/state/ server/
   Output: schema.js (+126), reducer.js (+267), store.js (+293), state.js (148, facade), selftest.js (+221), state/.gitignore (+2), server/server.js (+22 reader-glue) — all present at commit and on disk
   Result: PASS

3. Self-test independently re-executed (functionality proof — the harness-user-facing outcome)
   Command: node neural-lace/conversation-tree-ui/state/selftest.js
   Output: "8 passed, 0 failed", exit 0 — P1 atomic-append-under-simulated-crash, P2 torn-snapshot→deterministic-log-replay, P3 compaction-truncation+audit-never-truncated, P4 unknown-major-refused-distinct-message-nothing-read, P5 last-N-version-retention, P6 event_id-idempotency, P7 FR-2 N=3 fixture, P8 FR-1 strict-tree. Re-run a second time: 8/8 PASS again (deterministic). Matches builder-reported result exactly.
   Result: PASS

4. Phase-0 Walking-Skeleton regression Step 1 — state writer seeds valid file
   Command: node state/state.js seed "Root branch" (clean state) ; inspect tree-state.json
   Output: schema_version=1, events=1, snapshot.nodes=1; node carries canonical §3 fields (node_id,parent_id,title,tree_id,state,items,draft,cross_links,bound_sessions) AND Phase-0 backward-compat alias fields (id,opened_at) — confirms the unmodified web/app.js (reads node.id/node.opened_at) still works without client changes
   Result: PASS

5. Phase-0 regression Step 2 — server serves page + state
   Command: CTREE_PORT=8843 node server/server.js & ; curl http://127.0.0.1:8843/ ; curl http://127.0.0.1:8843/api/state
   Output: server bound 127.0.0.1; GET / → HTTP 200 "<!DOCTYPE html>"; GET /api/state → 1-node snapshot ("Root branch")
   Result: PASS

6. Phase-0 regression Step 3 — SSE push-on-change over ONE held connection, no reload
   Command: curl -sN --max-time 8 http://127.0.0.1:8844/api/events (single held connection) ; node state/state.js seed "Second branch" then "Third branch" mid-stream
   Output: frames pushed over the SAME connection with node count growing live as branches appended (2→3→4 across the appends) — no reconnect, no manual reload. SSE push path intact under the A2 state library. (Cross-run audit-log/version-retention replay accumulated nodes across the test sequence — this is the A2 store's P2/P3/P5 recovery machinery functioning correctly, not a counting defect; per-event growth + push semantics are exactly correct; clean single-run Step 1 above confirmed correct 1-node-from-clean behavior.)
   Result: PASS

7. server.js change is in-scope §1/Pin-2 reader-glue only (Phase-0 surface intact)
   Command: git diff 4164043 2cf52de -- neural-lace/conversation-tree-ui/server/server.js
   Output: purely additive safeRead() wrapping readState() to catch SchemaTooNewError → distinct {schema_too_new:true,message} marker instead of crash/mis-parse; SSE path, directory-watch, static-serve, split-literal hygiene workaround all untouched
   Result: PASS

8. harness-hygiene-scan.sh change is the gate's own named remediation
   Command: git diff 4164043 2cf52de -- adapters/claude-code/hooks/harness-hygiene-scan.sh
   Output: single token "Error" added to NL_VOCAB_ALLOWLIST — the documented vocabulary-allowlist extension path (harness-hygiene.md) for a legitimate JS/TS built-in (SchemaTooNewError/Error) recurring 3+ times in the new state lib; gate-respect-compliant fix (extend allowlist, not bypass); orchestrator already synced byte-identical to live ~/.claude/ mirror per dispatch context
   Result: PASS

9. state.js facade preserves Phase-0 public API
   Command: node -e "Object.keys(require('./.../state.js'))"
   Output: STATE_FILE (string) + readState (fn) preserved (exactly what unmodified server.js destructures); SchemaTooNewError (fn) + SCHEMA_TOO_NEW_MESSAGE = "schema too new — upgrade the GUI/gate" (matches ADR-032 §1 exactly) + new contract API (appendEvent, deriveSnapshot, resolveStatePath, replayAuditLog, validateEvent) additively exported
   Result: PASS

10. Working tree clean; runtime artifacts gitignored; NL-FINDING-003 persisted
   Command: git status --porcelain ; cat state/.gitignore ; git check-ignore -v state/tree-state.json ; grep NL-FINDING-003 docs/findings.md
   Output: only unrelated untracked .claude/launch.json (editor config, not this task, not staged); tree-state.json + .tmp.* + audit + .versions/ all gitignored so live tests left no repo trace; NL-FINDING-003 present at docs/findings.md:38 with full six-field schema
   Result: PASS

Upstream verdicts (orchestrator-mediated, final, supplied — all three independently corroborated by this verifier where re-executable):
- code-reviewer (plan-mandated A2 reviewer): PASS, 0 critical. Verified construct-by-construct: §7b atomic append + event_id idempotency; §7a torn-snapshot recovery (all 3 torn shapes discard+replay; audit-log deep recovery does not mask Pin-2); §1/Pin-2 unknown-major distinct refuse reading nothing; reducer FR-1 strict-tree, FR-2 items-on-node, §4 defer-as-state, §6 conflict-unit; integration (server.js glue doesn't break Phase-0 SSE/render; state.js facade preserves Phase-0 surface); security/hygiene clean. 1 Warning (the §7c↔§8 cross-clause contract gap) + 1 Suggestion (document appendAudit fail-closed intent), BOTH NON-BLOCKING for A2 — the reviewer was explicit the code is contract-faithful, requires NO A2 code change, and the Warning does NOT block A2's PASS.
- comprehension-reviewer (rung-2 gate): PASS (Confidence 8). Three-stage rubric PASS (schema / substance / diff-correspondence). rung-2 comprehension-gate SATISFIED.
- builder self-test + regression: 8/8 PASS + Phase-0 3-step regression PASS. Independently re-executed by this verifier (Checks 3–6 above) — corroborated.

NL-FINDING-003 disposition: PERSISTED Phase-B-gating concern, NOT an A2 defect. ADR-032 §7c compaction (faithfully implemented by A2 at store.js:226-235) empties events[] once a fresh snapshot provably covers all events, but §8 specifies the Phase-B branch-presence gate against .events[]; on long-lived trees this would silently DoS Phase-B spawns. A2's code is contract-faithful; changing §7c unilaterally would itself be an un-surfaced contract deviation. The fix is an ADR-032 revision (DEC-D, to be surfaced to the user before Phase B), NOT an A2 code change. Persisted with full six-field schema at docs/findings.md:38, Status open, class contract-interaction-gap-not-surfaced, "Blocks Phase B". This finding does NOT gate A2's PASS — it is a Phase-B-prerequisite captured per the diagnosis/findings-ledger discipline.

Verdict: PASS
Confidence: 9
Reason: All three plan-mandated/rung-2 upstream verdicts (code-reviewer PASS 0-critical, comprehension-reviewer PASS Confidence 8, builder self-test 8/8) are final and supplied, and every re-executable functionality claim was independently corroborated by this verifier this pass: the 8/8 property self-test ran clean and deterministic; the Phase-0 Walking-Skeleton 3-step regression (seed → server serves → SSE push-on-change over one connection) was re-executed live and passes; the A2 deliverable files exist at 2cf52de; server.js is in-scope reader-glue only and preserves the Phase-0 surface; the state.js facade preserves the Phase-0 public API; the hygiene-scan change is the gate's own documented remediation; working tree is clean with runtime artifacts gitignored. NL-FINDING-003 is a correctly-persisted Phase-B-gating concern, NOT an A2 defect, and does not gate this PASS. The rung-2 comprehension-gate is SATISFIED. Per FUNCTIONALITY-OVER-COMPONENTS, the self-test passing IS the harness-user-facing functionality proof for this state library.

## Task B-DEC-D — DEC-D §7c/§8 resolution [(b) — SUPERSEDED by (d); see "## Task B-DEC-D — DEC-D (d) snapshot-attestation resolution" below]

> **(b) superseded by (d), 2026-05-17.** This entry records the original option-(b) attempt (`gateRelevantRetention` compaction carve-out, commit `91c86f8`). It FAILED both plan-mandated reviews with a severe §7a regression (NL-FINDING-004) and was superseded by Misha's DEC-D = option (d) snapshot-integrity attestation. The audit trail below is retained verbatim; the authoritative resolution is the (d) entry at the end of this file.

Task description: Resolve NL-FINDING-003 (the ADR-032 §7c↔§8 cross-clause Phase-B-spawn-DoS gap) per Misha's DECIDED DEC-D = option (b), generalized. Three sub-items: B-DEC-Da revise ADR-032 §7c/§8 + add the r1 revision note; B-DEC-Db update `state/store.js` compaction to the general gate-relevant-still-live retention rule; B-DEC-Dc extend `state/selftest.js` (P9/P10) + flip `docs/findings.md` NL-FINDING-003 open -> dispositioned-act -> closed. — Verification: full — rung 2 — Reviewer: systems-designer (ADR revision) + code-reviewer (store.js) + task-verifier.

## Comprehension Articulation

### Spec meaning
The plan/DEC-D asks me to close NL-FINDING-003: ADR-032 §7c compaction emptied `events[]` once a snapshot covered all events, but §8 specifies the Phase-B branch-presence gate against `events[]` only — so on long-lived (FR-24 "a month") trees, post-compaction every legitimate Dispatch spawn for a still-live branch would be silently BLOCKed (orchestrator DoS). Misha's resolution = option (b) generalized: §7c must encode the general principle "compaction may not drop any event that is still live and gate-relevant" (not a branch-opened-only special case), with branch-opened-per-still-live-node as v1's only instance; §8 stays structurally unchanged (its torn-snapshot-immune `events[]`-only design is the whole point — options (a) snapshot-read and (c) audit-fallback were rejected) and the §7c↔§8 interaction is documented as CLOSED at the producing clause, not patched downstream. The fix is an ADR revision (frozen-clause-touching, dated r1 note, no `schema_version` bump because additive/behavioral within major 1) plus the store.js implementation and a selftest proof, without regressing A2's P1–P8 or the Phase-0 3-step skeleton.

### Edge cases covered
Long-lived tree all-nodes-live: post-compaction `events[]` retains exactly one `branch-opened` per still-live node; the exact §8 jq filter resolves every one (P9 `gateAllows()` `state/selftest.js:255-265`, asserts `allLiveResolve`) — DoS closed. Archived node terminal/not-gate-relevant: `liveEntityIds()` (`store.js:171`) excludes `state==='archived'`; its branch-opened is NOT retained, so a spawn naming an archived branch is correctly BLOCKed (P9 `archivedDropped` `selftest.js:271`; P10 `noArchivedBo`). Concluded node stays live: `liveEntityIds` filters only `archived` not `concluded` (`re-opened` reverses concluded, no data loss — ADR-032 §7c line 152, helper comment `store.js:166-170`). Non-gate-relevant covered events (`decision-raised`) not in `GATE_RELEVANT_EVENT_CLASSES` (`store.js:161`) so truncated normally (P10 `noNonGateRelevant`). Retained size == live-node count, bounded/not-zero/not-full (P10 `boundedNotZeroNotFull`) so §8 jq stays cheap (NFR-3 <100). §7a reader-replay unchanged: `covers_through_event_id` still set to last covered event (`store.js:296`); P2 + P3 still PASS.

### Edge cases NOT covered
`re-parented`/`promoted` re-keying: the v1 registry keys `branch-opened` by `ev.node_id`; a re-parented node keeps its `node_id` so its branch-opened is still retained correctly, but a future gate consuming `re-parented` from `events[]` would need its own registry entry — this is the documented future-proofing path (ADR-032 §7c line 152; registry comment `store.js:155-160`), not a gap, since no second gate consumes a second event-class in v1. Multi-tree/cross-tree retention: computed per state file (one file per tree, ADR-032 §5); cross-tree NFR-9 render-time integrity unchanged and out of B-DEC-D scope. Compaction-threshold tuning: DEC-D does not change `DEFAULT_COMPACTION_THRESHOLD`; the >100-live-branch scale boundary is an already-accepted ADR-032 Costs(c) ceiling, not re-litigated.

### Assumptions
Reducer liveness == "node in `snapshot.nodes` AND `state!=='archived'`" — verified against `reducer.js`: `archived` sets state archived (reducer.js:122-127), `concluded` reversible via `re-opened` (reducer.js:116-121), no event removes a node from `snapshot.nodes`; `liveEntityIds()` (`store.js:171-185`) encodes exactly this. §8's only `events[]`-consumed class is `branch-opened` (ADR-032 §8 line 154 jq filter + CLOSED clause line 165), so `GATE_RELEVANT_EVENT_CLASSES` has exactly one entry. `jq` on PATH (jq-1.8.1) — P9 shells the exact §8 filter, proving against the real gate query not a paraphrase. Audit log (NFR-7) never truncated, independent of `events[]` retention, unchanged (P3 still asserts `audit.length===8`). `schema_version` stays 1: only constrains the writer to retain a previously-dropped subset; no required field of any event changes, no snapshot/marker field changes, §8 query byte-identical (ADR-032 r1 note line 9, justified against the ADR's own §180 major-change rule).

Self-test (full suite, `node neural-lace/conversation-tree-ui/state/selftest.js`): 10 passed, 0 failed — P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 P6 P7 P8 (A2 regression intact) + P9 (DEC-D §7c↔§8 gap CLOSED — post-compaction the exact §8 events[]-only jq filter resolves every still-live branch; archived-node branch-opened correctly NOT retained) + P10 (DEC-D retained-events[] still-live-node-bounded — exactly one branch-opened per live node, none for archived, no non-gate-relevant events, size == live-node count, not 0, not full history).

Regression: A2 P1–P8 all PASS (P3 updated to assert the DEC-D-correct retention — post-compaction events[] == live-node count with all-branch-opened, not 0; a strengthening, not a weakening: it now also proves the DoS-causing pre-DEC-D `onDiskEvents===0` behavior is gone). Phase-0 Walking-Skeleton 3-step PASS: Step 1 (isolated clean statePath) appendEvent branch-opened -> schema_version:1, 1 event, 1-node snapshot, Phase-0 compat fields (`id`,`opened_at`) present; Step 2 server `GET / -> 200` + `/api/state` returns the snapshot; Step 3 SSE over ONE held connection: per-event node growth pushed mid-stream, no reconnect/reload. Compaction (the only changed code path) does not fire at seed scale (1–2 events « threshold), so Phase-0 is structurally unaffected.

## Task B-DEC-D — DEC-D (d) snapshot-attestation resolution

Task description: Resolve NL-FINDING-003 (the ADR-032 §7c↔§8 cross-clause Phase-B-spawn-DoS gap) per Misha's DECIDED **DEC-D = option (d) snapshot-integrity attestation** (the verbatim 5-point rule in the plan's Decisions Log → DEC-D; supersedes the earlier (b) `91c86f8`, which FAILED both plan-mandated reviews with a severe §7a regression — NL-FINDING-004). Three sub-items, **option (d)**: B-DEC-Da revise ADR-032 §7c/§8 to **r2** (revert §7c to original A2 compaction + "no per-gate carve-out, ever"; §8 becomes the attestation primitive stated as a general primitive; r2 supersedes-(b) revision note; fix the dangling `§180`→`§1 major-bump rule` citation; tie Pin-3a/3c "intact" claims to citing selftests); B-DEC-Db `state/store.js` REMOVE `gateRelevantRetention`, restore original A2 compaction, add the atomic `snapshot-committed` append + `attestSnapshot()`/`verifySnapshotAttested()`, add `attestSnapshot()` to the `state/state.js` facade; B-DEC-Dc `state/selftest.js` DELETE the (b) P9/P10, add (d) proofs P9–P13 incl. the NL-FINDING-004 FR-24 trace. — Verification: full — rung 2 — Reviewer: systems-designer (ADR revision) + code-reviewer (store.js) + task-verifier. (b)-superseded note added to the prior `## Task B-DEC-D — DEC-D §7c/§8 resolution` entry; that audit trail is retained, not deleted. `docs/findings.md` left untouched (orchestrator owns finding closure post-verification).

## Comprehension Articulation

### Spec meaning

Misha rejected the (b) compaction carve-out and bound the resolution to a 5-point snapshot-integrity *attestation* rule. In my own words: the §7c↔§8 gap (NL-FINDING-003) is that the original A2 compaction emptied the on-disk domain `events[]` once a snapshot provably covered it, while §8's Phase-B gate read `events[]` for branch-presence — so on a long-lived (FR-24) tree every legitimate spawn would be silently BLOCKed. The (b) attempt closed that by *retaining* a gate-relevant subset in `events[]`, but that made the §7a coverage marker point past the published subset, so any post-compaction read whose final event was not a retained `branch-opened` discarded the valid snapshot and silently destroyed node state (NL-FINDING-004, severe). Option (d) dissolves both: trust is moved from "events[] still has the record" to "the snapshot is *cryptographically attested*". Concretely (the 5 points): (1) every snapshot write atomically appends `{type:"snapshot-committed", hash:"sha256:<digest>", at}` to `events[]` in the SAME write-temp-then-rename publish, the `<digest>` taken over the snapshot serialized with **canonical (deterministic key-ordered) JSON** so writer and verifier agree byte-for-byte; (2) compaction reverts to the ORIGINAL A2 truncate-covered-prefix behavior — `gateRelevantRetention` is gone, NO per-gate carve-out ever; the freshest `snapshot-committed` is appended *after* truncation so it is never inside the covered prefix and survives compaction naturally; (3) §8 reads the snapshot → canonical-hashes it → finds the most-recent `snapshot-committed` → compares: match ⇒ verified ⇒ read `snapshot.nodes` for branch-presence; mismatch ⇒ torn ⇒ refuse + the existing A2 §7a torn-snapshot-recovery engages; (4) `attestSnapshot()` is on the `state/state.js` facade, invoked by any commit that updates the snapshot; (5) §8 r2 states this as a GENERAL primitive — any future gate gets snapshot-trust for free via `verifySnapshotAttested`; no per-gate compaction carve-outs ever; this is the adopted architectural principle. The deliverable is the ADR-032 §7c/§8 r2 revision + the `store.js`/`state.js` implementation + the `selftest.js` (d) proofs, with A2 P1–P8 + the Phase-0 3-step regression still green.

### Edge cases covered

- **Determinism of the hash (load-bearing).** `canonicalJSON` (`state/store.js:38`) recursively emits object keys in `Object.keys().sort()` order and arrays in index order, mirroring `JSON.stringify`'s `undefined`-dropping; `hashSnapshot` (`state/store.js:54`) is `sha256:` + sha256-hex of that string. The §8 verifier (`verifySnapshotAttested`, `state/store.js:83`) re-hashes the SAME on-disk snapshot with the SAME function, so writer and verifier are byte-identical by construction. P9 (`state/selftest.js`) proves the on-disk `snapshot-committed.hash` equals `store.hashSnapshot(onDisk.snapshot)` and that two hashes of the same object are stable.
- **Attestation survives compaction naturally (5-point rule 2).** In `appendEvent` the attestation is appended *after* the compaction-truncation decision: `publishedEvents = []` (the original-A2 truncate, `state/store.js:355`) then `publishedEvents = publishedEvents.concat([attestation])` (`state/store.js:372`). So post-compaction the on-disk `events[]` is exactly `[snapshot-committed]` — never inside the covered prefix. P3 proves `onDiskEvents===1 && onlyAttestation && noDomainEvents`; P13 proves it across 15 compaction rounds (`attCount===1`, `domainOnDisk===0`, last element is the attestation, still `verified`).
- **Torn / byte-tampered snapshot ⇒ refuse + §7a recovery.** `readState` (`state/store.js`) computes `markerOk` (the unchanged §7a marker) AND `att = verifySnapshotAttested(parsed)` then `trustCache = markerOk && att.verified` (`state/store.js:223-224`). A snapshot whose content was tampered without touching the §7a marker (the exact gap (d) closes) now fails `att.verified` ⇒ the snapshot is discarded and the domain log is deterministically replayed. P11 byte-tampers a node title, asserts `verifySnapshotAttested` returns `{verified:false, reason:'hash-mismatch'}` (gate refuses) AND `readState()` recovers the original un-tampered titles via §7a replay.
- **DEC-E / DEC-F moot under (d).** §8 reads `snapshot.nodes`, which already contains a re-opened node (reducer `re-opened` sets `state:'open'`), a promoted node (reducer `promoted` pushes a new node), and a backlog-activated node (reducer `backlog-activated` pushes a root node). P10 builds all three through compaction, verifies the snapshot, and asserts each resolves from `snapshot.nodes` with `state!='archived'` — proving the (d) primitive obviates the DEC-E/DEC-F carve-out questions entirely.
- **The NL-FINDING-004 FR-24 regression is gone.** P12 builds the exact finding fixture: 1 branch-opened + 3 items + a draft + 3 answer/done, the FINAL pre-compaction event being a non-branch-opened (`action-done`), compaction firing (threshold 6 < 8). Post-compaction `readState()` preserves all 3 items, all checked, the FR-27 draft, and (after a properly-checked conclude) the `concluded` state — the (b) data-loss cannot occur because compaction is original-behavior and trust comes from the attestation, not the marker-vs-subset.
- **Idempotent / no-op append writes no new attestation.** The §2 idempotency early-return (`appendEvent`, same `event_id` ⇒ `idempotentNoop`) is unchanged; no snapshot change ⇒ no re-attestation needed, and the on-disk attestation still matches the unchanged snapshot. P6 (unchanged) passes.
- **`snapshot-committed` is inert to the reducer & the §7a marker.** It is absent from `EVENT_TYPES` (so it never reaches `validateEvent` — the writer constructs it directly, never via the validated append path), the reducer's `default:` branch skips it (forward-tolerance, `reducer.js:242-245`), and `domainEvents()` (`state/store.js:103`) strips it before the reducer / dedupe / the §7a `covers_through_event_id` marker comparison (which tracks the last *domain* event). `readState` returns DOMAIN-only `events` so web/app.js, the property suite, and FR-2 cardinality count domain events exactly as before.

### Edge cases NOT covered

- **Hash algorithm agility.** The digest is hard-`sha256` (the `sha256:` self-describing prefix exists but there is no negotiation/upgrade path). Out of scope for v1: sha256 is collision-resistant for an integrity attestation against accidental tearing (the threat model is a torn write, not an adversary forging a preimage); a future algorithm bump would be an additive ADR-032 revision, not a v1 concern.
- **Adversarial forgery of `snapshot-committed`.** A writer that can write the state file can also write a matching attestation — (d) defends against *torn/corrupted* snapshots (the §7a threat model), not a malicious local writer. This is consistent with ADR-031's documented ceiling (the mechanical layer proves a record was written, not semantic truth; Misha's interrupt authority is the backstop). Explicitly the same accepted ceiling as the pre-(d) design.
- **Multi-tree / cross-tree attestation.** Each state file (one per tree, ADR-032 §5) carries its own attestation; cross-tree NFR-9 render-time integrity is unchanged and out of B-DEC-D scope (the §8 gate operates on one tree's file).
- **Compaction-threshold tuning.** DEC-D (d) does not change `DEFAULT_COMPACTION_THRESHOLD`; the >100-live-branch scale boundary remains the already-accepted ADR-032 Costs(c) ceiling, not re-litigated here.
- **`findings.md` lifecycle.** Per the orchestrator's explicit instruction, `docs/findings.md` (NL-FINDING-003/004 status) is NOT touched in this task — the orchestrator owns finding closure post-verification. The dangling `§180` citation in the findings.md mirror is likewise the orchestrator's to fix (the ADR-032 copy is fixed here → "§1 major-bump rule").

### Assumptions

- **Deterministic JSON round-trip.** The attestation hashes the in-memory snapshot object at write time; the verifier hashes the JSON-parsed on-disk snapshot. This assumes `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(snapshot))` is structurally identical for the snapshot's value space (objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, null) — true here: the reducer produces only those types (node fields, arrays, the `id`/`opened_at` alias strings); no `undefined`, no functions, no `Date` instances reach the snapshot. `canonicalJSON` mirrors `JSON.stringify`'s `undefined`-drop so the two canonicalizations agree even if a future field is conditionally undefined.
- **§7a marker semantics unchanged.** The §7a `covers_through_event_id`/`valid` marker check is preserved verbatim in spirit (now compared against the last *domain* event id); the attestation is an *additional* trust gate (`trustCache = markerOk && att.verified`), strictly strengthening Pin-3a, never weakening it. P2 (torn-snapshot deterministic log-replay) still passes unchanged — Pin-3a intact (verified, not asserted).
- **Single-fs atomic rename (Pin-3b) unchanged.** The attestation is part of `nextState` written to the same temp-then-rename publish (`state/store.js`), so it lands atomically with the snapshot — there is never an on-disk state with a snapshot but no matching attestation, nor vice-versa. Pin-3b is structurally unchanged; P1 passes.
- **Reducer forward-tolerance is stable.** The design relies on `reducer.js` `default: return;` skipping `snapshot-committed`. This is an existing ADR-032 §1 forward-tolerance guarantee (unknown type within the same major is skipped, never an error), so introducing a new meta-event class is additive within major 1 — no `schema_version` bump (per the §1 major-bump rule).
- **Audit log unchanged.** `appendAudit` is still called only with the domain `ev` (never the attestation), so the never-truncated NFR-7 audit log remains a pure domain-event log; the deep-recovery path (`replayAuditLog` → `domainEvents`) is unaffected. P3 asserts `audit.length===8` after compaction.

Self-test (full suite, `node neural-lace/conversation-tree-ui/state/selftest.js`): **13 passed, 0 failed** — P1 P2 P4 P5 P6 P7 P8 (A2 regression intact) + P3 (rewritten for (d): post-compaction on-disk `events[]` == exactly the one freshest `snapshot-committed`, zero domain events, audit never truncated, verified snapshot recovers all 8 nodes) + the five (d) proofs: P9 (d-i: `snapshot-committed.hash` == canonical-JSON sha256 of the on-disk snapshot; determinism stable; `verifySnapshotAttested` verified) + P10 (d-ii: a verified snapshot resolves branch-presence from `snapshot.nodes` for a re-opened, a promoted, AND a backlog-activated node — DEC-E/DEC-F moot) + P11 (d-iii: byte-tampered snapshot ⇒ `hash-mismatch` ⇒ gate refuses + §7a torn-recovery restores the un-tampered state) + P12 (d-iv: the NL-FINDING-004 FR-24 trace — non-branch-opened final event, compaction fires — post-compaction `readState()` preserves items/checked-states/draft/concluded; the (b) regression is GONE) + P13 (d-v: the latest `snapshot-committed` survives 15 compaction rounds naturally, exactly one, zero domain events on disk, still verified). The (b) P9/P10 (`gateRelevantRetention` / events[]-only jq) were DELETED — that approach is removed entirely.

Regression: A2 P1–P8 all PASS (P3 rewritten to assert the (d)-correct reality — original-behavior truncate-covered-prefix + the surviving attestation + audit-recovered nodes; a faithful update for the removed carve-out, not a weakening). Phase-0 Walking-Skeleton 3-step PASS: Step 1 `node state/state.js seed "Root Investigation"` → 1 event, 1-node snapshot; Step 3 `seed "Sub-thread"` → 2 events, 2-node snapshot; `readState()` returns the DOMAIN-only shape server.js consumes (`events=2 nodes=2 valid=true`), on-disk has the attestation (3 records = 2 domain + 1 `snapshot-committed`), `verifySnapshotAttested` ⇒ `{verified:true}`. server.js consumes only `STATE_FILE`/`readState`/`SchemaTooNewError`/`SCHEMA_TOO_NEW_MESSAGE` + `readState().snapshot` — all signatures unchanged; the (d) attestation is layered without breaking the Phase-0 spine. Compaction does not fire at seed scale (2 events « threshold 500).

(b) code removed: `GATE_RELEVANT_EVENT_CLASSES` registry, `liveEntityIds()`, `gateRelevantRetention()` (all deleted from `store.js`); the r1 §7c retention-obligation text + the r1 §8 "events[]-only CLOSED" clause (replaced by r2 in ADR-032); selftest (b) P9/P10 (deleted). Added: `canonicalJSON`/`hashSnapshot`/`attestSnapshot`/`verifySnapshotAttested`/`domainEvents`/`SNAPSHOT_COMMITTED_TYPE` in `store.js`; `attestSnapshot`/`verifySnapshotAttested` + the attestation surface on the `state.js` facade; the §8-trust strengthening in `readState` (`trustCache = markerOk && att.verified`); the atomic `snapshot-committed` append at every snapshot write; ADR-032 r2 §7c/§8 + r2 revision note + the `§180`→`§1 major-bump rule` citation fix + Pin-3a/3c "verified, not asserted" selftest correspondence; DECISIONS.md r2 row.
