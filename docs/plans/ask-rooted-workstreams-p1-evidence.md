# Evidence — ask-rooted-workstreams-p1

Per-task completion evidence + comprehension articulations for the rung-4 plan
`docs/plans/ask-rooted-workstreams-p1.md`. Each task's articulation is authored by
its builder (comprehension gate, rung ≥ 2) and graded by `comprehension-reviewer`
before `task-verifier` flips the checkbox.

## Task 1 — Walking skeleton (merged: master `a96f5dd`; builder worktree commit `63fa574`)

Substance verified independently (task-verifier, 2026-07-11): all 9 files present and
wired; `progress-log-lib.sh` self-test 10/10; `plan-lifecycle.sh` self-test OK (incl.
scenarios 11–13); `progress-log.sh` 5/5; `ask-registry.sh` stub 7/7; `/api/asks` data
path traced hook→lib→file→API→DOM; render path (`web/asks.js` → `#asksSkeletonBody`)
reads the mechanism-emitted `summary` with no intermediate-shape substitution.

### Comprehension Articulation

#### Spec meaning — what Task 1's spec ("walking skeleton: one event end-to-end") asked for
The spec asked to prove ONE progress event can travel every architectural layer of the
ask-rooted-workstreams system before any breadth is built — the tracer-bullet discipline
that de-risks the integrations the "built-but-not-wired" pattern leaves dangling. A single
task-verifier checkbox flip (`- [ ] N.` → `- [x] N.`) must: be OBSERVED by a splice in the
already-wired `plan-lifecycle.sh` PostToolUse hook (never emitted by model memory, never
flipping the box itself — constraint 6), pass through a `progress-log.sh emit` CLI to
`pl_emit`, land as one deduped JSONL line in a per-ask log under
`~/.claude/state/progress-logs/`, be read back by a new `GET /api/asks`, and render as
"task N verified done" on the landing page. The final versioned event schema (Task 2's
table) is required even in the skeleton so later hardening never forces a format migration.
NOT the full feature — grouping/drift-badges/lifecycle/auto-capture are later tasks.

#### Edge cases covered
- **BASH_SOURCE lazy-resolution bug (found+fixed):** `plan-lifecycle.sh:81` resolves
  `_PL_HOOK_DIR` once at load, before the `--self-test` path's `cd` into a fixture repo;
  the splice at `:290` uses that absolute path. Lazy `BASH_SOURCE[0]` inside the function
  located the CLI against the wrong cwd once any prior `cd` had run (initial scenario-11 FAIL).
- **Fresh-flip vs re-save:** `plan-lifecycle.sh:299` skips task ids already in the pre-edit
  checked set; defense-in-depth `pl_emit` natural-key dedup at `progress-log-lib.sh:281`.
  Self-test scenario 12 asserts unchanged line-count after a no-flip re-save.
- **No `ask-id:` header → unlinked log, never dropped:** `plan-lifecycle.sh:276` extracts
  header ask-id; absent → `pl_path_for` (`progress-log-lib.sh:133`) falls back to `unlinked`.
  Scenario 13 proves the event lands in `unlinked.jsonl` rather than being discarded.
- **Sandbox env parity:** lib (`progress-log-lib.sh:109`), hook self-test
  (`plan-lifecycle.sh:531`), and server (`server.js:172`) all honor `PROGRESS_LOG_STATE_DIR`.
- **Emitter allowlist / provenance:** `progress-log-lib.sh:268` stamps `provenance=unknown`
  for emitters outside `_PL_KNOWN_EMITTERS` (`:103`) — the open CLI cannot impersonate a
  mechanism (constraint 10); lib self-test scenario 5 asserts it.
- **Corrupt/missing JSONL:** `server.js:187` `readJsonlLines` skips unparseable lines;
  `/api/asks` (`:256`) try/catch returns `{ok:false}` — the landing never 500s on one bad record.

#### Edge cases NOT covered
- **No browser-rendered screenshot** — data path proven via `curl /api/asks`; DOM render
  (`asks.js:56`) not exercised in a real browser (no Chrome/puppeteer in build env). Card
  visibility verified structurally, not visually. (Covered later: Task 13 + end-user-advocate.)
- **`ask-registry.sh` is a deliberate Task-1 stub** (`:8`, `:266`): only register/list;
  attach-session/link-plan/set-status/merge/summarizer/mirror/auto-capture are Task 8.
- **Concurrency not stress-tested** — O_APPEND single-line writes (`progress-log-lib.sh:306`)
  but the concurrent-append + full replay-dedup battery is Task 2.
- **Dedup key coverage partial by design** — `_pl_natural_key` (`:189`) implements every
  Task-2 table row but only `task_done`/`task_started` have fixtures here; `plan_amended`/
  `plan_completed` content-hash keys wired, exercised by Tasks 5/6.
- **`/api/asks` payload NOT schema-validated** — no anti-noise/absolute-href enforcement
  yet; that is Task 11.
- **No auditor / drift reconciliation / orphan-lane reattachment** — Task 2/12.

#### Assumptions
- `plan-lifecycle.sh` is PostToolUse Edit|Write-wired (`settings.json.template:321`) and
  receives post-edit plan content read from disk.
- The `pl_emit` CLI signature is a FROZEN contract Tasks 3–6 depend on:
  `emit --type/--ask/--plan-slug/--task-id/--sha/--needs-you-id/--session-id/--summary/
  --evidence-link/--emitter/--dedup-extra`; every schema field implemented now.
- State dir `~/.claude/state/progress-logs/<ask-id>.jsonl` is machine-local, NOT an
  in-repo durable write, so it correctly does NOT route through `nl_main_checkout_root`
  (constraint 11 governs in-repo writes only); server honors `CTREE_PORT` for sandbox.
- `ask-id:` header is a single whitespace-delimited token; `extract_ask_id`
  (`plan-lifecycle.sh:252`) parses exactly that, matching the frozen plan's own header.
- `sha1sum`/`openssl`/`cksum` present for the portable hash; `jq` available; readers
  `tr -d '\r'` defensively given MSYS/CRLF history; repo pins `eol=lf`.
- Additive UI — `app.js` need not know about `asks.js` in this task (it becomes
  shell/router only at Task 13); `asks.js` no-ops if its container is absent (`asks.js:21`).
