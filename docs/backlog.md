# Neural Lace — Harness Backlog

Last updated: 2026-04-24 (added: P1 — concurrent ACTIVE plans need acceptance-exempt declaration before next session-end. Earlier: capture-codify P2 entries — FM-NNN cite verification, answer-form telemetry, template-validator atomicity gate)

Outstanding improvements to the Claude Code harness (rules, agents, hooks, skills). Project-level backlogs live in individual project repos; this file tracks harness-level work.

Strategy context and reasoning for many entries below lives in [`docs/claude-code-quality-strategy.md`](./claude-code-quality-strategy.md).

## Known gaps in current enforcement (from strategy doc, 2026-04-22)

These are residual risks in the Gen 4+ harness. Each is documented honestly rather than left hidden.

### P1 — Verbal vaporware in conversation is not mechanically blocked

Claude Code has no PostMessage hook. `claim-reviewer` is self-invoked and can be skipped. When the agent makes a feature claim in conversation without citing file:line, no mechanism catches it. Current mitigation: user reflex to ask for citations. Closing requires either a PostMessage hook in Claude Code itself or an adversarial post-response review agent that fires on every Nth response.

### P1 — Tool-call-budget `--ack` attestation is bypassable

The `tool-call-budget.sh` hook looks for sentinel lines in `~/.claude/state/reviews/`. A builder agent could Write that file directly without actually invoking `plan-evidence-reviewer`. Friction is raised but not cryptographically closed. Closing requires either per-session HMAC signing or architectural support for observing Task tool invocations.

### P1 — Concurrent-session state collisions (plan-wipe incidents)

Multiple Claude Code sessions on the same machine share `~/.claude/` state and the git working tree. Uncommitted plan files have been lost to concurrent-session `git stash`/`clean` operations on multiple documented occasions (2026-04-19, 2026-04-20). A project-level plan addressing commit-on-creation is in flight, but cross-session state coordination (shared `~/.claude/` directory) is still unresolved.

### P2 — `plan-lifecycle.sh` archival staging misses content change

Surfaced 2026-04-23 (during plan #5's own self-archival, commit 93ef15d). When the Status field is edited, the hook stages a `git mv` to archive but does NOT stage the actual Status text change. Resulting commit captures the rename only; the content change sits unstaged in the working tree at the new path, requiring a manual follow-up `git add <new-path> && git commit`.

**Fix candidates:**
- (a) Hook also runs `git add <new-path>` after the `git mv` so the content change is staged together with the rename. Risk: if the new path doesn't exist yet (race condition with the rename being staged but not committed), `git add` may fail.
- (b) Hook emits a clear warning message reminding the user to `git add <new-path>` before committing. Pattern enforcement, not mechanism.
- (c) Hook moves the file via `mv` (filesystem rename) BEFORE the Edit tool's content change reaches disk, then user does `git add -A` which captures both as a single staged change. Requires hook re-architecture.

Workaround pattern (used 2026-04-23): commit twice — first commit captures the rename (zero-content change), second commit captures the Status text update. See plan #5's archival commits 93ef15d + 6f4c057.

### P1 — Concurrent ACTIVE plans need acceptance-exempt declaration before next session-end (2026-04-24)

After Phase D of `docs/plans/end-user-advocate-acceptance-loop.md` registered `product-acceptance-gate.sh` as Stop-hook position 4, two concurrent ACTIVE plans will block session end on the next session unless reconciled:

- `docs/plans/claude-remote-adoption.md`
- `docs/plans/class-aware-review-feedback-smoke-test-plan.md`

Both are harness-dev plans without a product-user surface. Per `rules/acceptance-scenarios.md`'s exemption guidance, each should declare `acceptance-exempt: true` with a substantive `acceptance-exempt-reason:` (>= 20 chars). The third concurrent plan, `end-user-advocate-acceptance-loop.md` itself, has already been declared exempt in Phase D (bootstrap meta-plan rationale).

**Fix path:** in the next session, edit each plan file's header to add the two fields. Example for `claude-remote-adoption.md`:
```
acceptance-exempt: true
acceptance-exempt-reason: Harness-development plan (Claude Code remote-mode adoption); no product-user surface to verify at runtime — the maintainer exercises the harness in subsequent sessions.
```

Until done, sessions ending while these plans are ACTIVE will hit a BLOCK with a clear remediation message from `product-acceptance-gate.sh`. Per-session waiver is also available as a fallback (`echo "..." > .claude/state/acceptance-waiver-<slug>-$(date +%s).txt`).

### P1 — `plan-phase-builder` sub-agent dispatched without Task tool — cannot invoke `task-verifier` (2026-04-23)

When the orchestrator dispatches a `plan-phase-builder` sub-agent (the dispatch type used while building Phase A of `docs/plans/archive/robust-plan-file-lifecycle.md`), the sub-agent's tool surface does NOT include the Task tool — it is not in the top-level tool list and is also not surfaced via ToolSearch (`select:Task` returns no results). Consequence: the sub-agent cannot invoke `task-verifier` as instructed by both the orchestrator-pattern rule and the dispatch prompt. The builder must fall back to writing evidence blocks directly under the evidence-first protocol enforced by `plan-edit-validator.sh` + `runtime-verification-executor.sh` — which works (the harness was specifically designed to allow this path), but it conflicts with the rule's "only `task-verifier` flips checkboxes" framing. Two possible fixes: (a) ensure dispatched `plan-phase-builder` sub-agents inherit the Task tool so they can invoke `task-verifier`; (b) update `~/.claude/rules/orchestrator-pattern.md` and the dispatch-prompt boilerplate to explicitly authorize the evidence-first fallback when Task is unavailable, with a written rationale. Either way, the current mismatch between the rule and the runtime tool surface should be reconciled. Reference instance: this Phase A build (commits d2d1494 + 4cc9c2a on `feat/robust-plan-file-lifecycle`).

## Improvements surfaced by 2026-04-22 strategy review

Prioritized order of leverage. Full reasoning in `docs/claude-code-quality-strategy.md` section "Additional Suggestions for Improvement."

### P0 — Harness-tests-itself: synthetic session runner

Build a tool that runs synthetic Claude Code sessions against known-bad scenarios and measures whether hooks catch them (unauthorized checkbox flip, mocked integration test, uncited feature claim, budget exhaustion without audit). Runs on demand or weekly via `/schedule`. Produces a report showing which enforcement mechanisms have regressed. This catches silent enforcement regressions — currently invisible.

### P2 — Claude Code doesn't dynamically load new agents OR hooks added mid-session

Surfaced 2026-04-23. Two confirmed instances of the same root cause:

- **Agents:** the `plan-phase-builder` agent file exists at both `~/.claude/agents/plan-phase-builder.md` and `adapters/claude-code/agents/plan-phase-builder.md`, but a session that started before the file was added returns "Agent type 'plan-phase-builder' not found" when invoked via the Task tool. Workaround: use `general-purpose` agent with orchestrator-pattern discipline inlined in the prompt.
- **Hooks:** the `plan-deletion-protection.sh` hook was registered via `jq` into `~/.claude/settings.json`'s PreToolUse Bash matcher mid-session. A subsequent `rm docs/plans/dpc-test.md` (which the hook should BLOCK per its self-test scenario 1) was NOT blocked — the file was deleted with exit code 0. The hook's `--self-test` passes 14/14 in a fresh subprocess invocation, proving the hook logic is correct. The session simply isn't aware of the new hook registration. Workaround: end and re-start the session (or rely on next-session activation, which is acceptable for non-urgent enforcement additions).

Mitigation candidates:
- (a) Document the limitation in `harness-maintenance.md` so future Claude sessions know to restart after adding new agents.
- (b) SessionStart hook that re-scans `~/.claude/agents/` and writes a "missing agents" warning if any expected agent isn't loaded — surface staleness without forcing a restart.
- (c) Investigate whether Claude Code has an agent-reload command; if so, document it.

Low priority because the workaround (general-purpose dispatch with inlined discipline) is functional and the issue resolves on next session start.

### P1 — Class-aware reviewer feedback Mod 2: pre-commit class-sweep attestation hook

Deferred from the original bundled "Class-aware reviewer feedback (narrow-fix bias mitigation)" entry on 2026-04-23. Mods 1 + 3 of that entry are absorbed by the `class-aware-review-feedback` plan. Mod 2 stays in the backlog pending evidence that Mods 1+3 alone don't fully close the narrow-fix-bias pattern.

**Pattern this would address:** adversarial reviewers identify named instances; LLM builders fix the named instances; sibling instances of the same defect class slip; next pass surfaces a sibling; loop. Surfaced across 5 `systems-designer` iterations on the `capture-codify-pr-template` plan (2026-04-23). Affects every adversarial-review loop in the harness.

**Proposal:** New PreToolUse hook `class-sweep-attestation.sh` (matching `git commit`) that detects fix-commits — message contains "amend" / "fix" / "address review" AND a prior reviewer FAIL exists in `~/.claude/state/reviews/`. Requires the commit message to include a `Class-sweep: <pattern> — N matches, M fixed` line. Blocks commit otherwise. Estimated effort: ~6 hrs (with self-test); existing `bug-persistence-gate.sh` is a good template.

**Trigger to revive:** if after `class-aware-review-feedback` ships, an adversarial-review loop still produces 3+ rounds of FAIL where each round surfaces a sibling instance of a defect class the prior round was supposed to address, that's the signal to ship Mod 2. Until then, the prose-layer interventions (Mod 1 + Mod 3) are believed sufficient.

### P1 — Verify class-aware reviewer feedback in next session (live agent invocation) (2026-04-23)

The `class-aware-review-feedback` plan completed Task A.10 with the smoke-test fixture at `docs/plans/class-aware-review-feedback-smoke-test-plan.md` and a sweep-query verification (9 matches against the seeded class), but could NOT live-invoke the modified `systems-designer` agent because (a) sub-agents dispatched as `plan-phase-builder` lack the Task tool (P1 above), and (b) agent definitions are loaded at session start, so in-session prompt edits don't activate until the next session (P2 below). Next-session work: invoke the modified `systems-designer` agent on the smoke-test fixture (or a fresh equivalent) and verify the agent output contains the six-field block structure (`Line(s):`, `Defect:`, `Class:`, `Sweep query:`, `Required fix:`, `Required generalization:`) for at least the seeded `generic-placeholder-section` defect class. Compare the agent's emitted sweep query against the expected sweep query in the evidence file's section C. If the agent does NOT reliably emit the six-field structure, that's the signal to either tighten the prompt language or escalate to Mod 2 (the pre-commit `class-sweep-attestation.sh` hook above). After verification, the throwaway smoke-test fixture file can be deleted.

### P1 — Prompt template library for meta-questions

Codify canonical meta-questions as slash commands or skills: `/why-did-this-bug-slip`, `/find-my-bugs`, `/make-this-plan-verbose`, `/harness-this-lesson`. Currently these patterns live in individual memory; codifying makes them reusable and consistent.

### P1 — Delegability classification on plan tasks

Every plan task declares: fully-delegable / review-at-phase / interactive. Shapes dispatch automatically — fully-delegable auto-dispatches to background sessions, review-at-phase produces PRs at phase boundaries, interactive stays in foreground. Replaces per-task manual routing decisions.

### P1 — Explicit interactive vs autonomous session mode

Session-start directive declaring interactive (human watching; more permissive) or autonomous (human not watching; stricter gates, auto-commit plans, harder enforcement). Same cadence shouldn't apply to both modes.

### P2 — Effort-level enforcement at project level

`.claude/minimum-effort.json` in project root declares minimum effort level. SessionStart hook warns if effort is below project minimum. Eliminates "forgot to set max" errors on quality-critical projects.

### P2 — Multi-model routing strategy

Codify model assignment per task type: Opus for planning/adversarial review/judgment; Sonnet for implementation; Haiku for mechanical operations. Partially done via individual agent frontmatter; could be more systematic via a central routing config.

### P2 — Scheduled retrospectives via `/schedule`

Weekly scheduled agent that reads the week's completed plans, decisions, and failure-mode entries; proposes harness improvements based on patterns; drafts `docs/retrospectives/YYYY-WW.md`. Turns ad-hoc "half my time on the harness" into systematic weekly attention.

### P2 — Session observability dashboard

Lightweight `claude-status` command aggregating active sessions (local + `--remote`), active plans, tool-call budget consumption, recent hook firings, uncommitted work at risk of wipe. Aggregates existing state files — no new infrastructure needed.

### P2 — Harness version contracts

Each project declares `harness-version: >=N` in its CLAUDE.md. Breaking harness changes bump the version. SessionStart warns if project version predates current harness. Prevents silent regressions as harness evolves beyond what older projects expected.

### P1 — Mysterious `effortLevel` wipe during session (2026-04-22/23)

Observed: `~/.claude/settings.json` started the session with `effortLevel: "max"`. Partway through, a subsequent `jq -r '.effortLevel'` returned `null` (key removed or value nulled). No task in the executing plan intentionally touched this field. Neither the main session nor any dispatched builder agent reported editing it.

Plausible causes:
- A PreToolUse or PostToolUse hook silently normalizing settings.json (e.g., a JSON rewriter that drops unknown keys)
- A concurrent session on the same machine overwriting settings.json with an older version (the concurrent-session state collision pattern we already have logged)
- An `install.sh` re-run during the session restoring from a template that had the key but was processed incorrectly
- A tool call with a full-file Write to settings.json that didn't preserve the effortLevel field

Remediation needed:
- Audit every hook that reads/writes `~/.claude/settings.json` for normalization that could drop top-level keys
- Consider adding a SessionStart hook that snapshots `settings.json` to `~/.claude/state/settings-snapshot.json` and, on next SessionStart, diffs against the current file to surface silent mutations
- Document the root cause once identified, then add a test/guard

Until fixed: users should periodically check `jq -r '.effortLevel' ~/.claude/settings.json` is not `null`. The existing `effort-policy-warn.sh` hook catches this indirectly (will warn if env var is unset and settings is missing the key AND policy requires non-low).

### P1 — Harness-work plans have no tracked home

Per `harness-hygiene.md`, the harness repo adds `docs/plans/` to `.gitignore` (harness repos don't ship instance artifacts). But harness-dev work DOES produce plan files, and those plans have no naturally-tracked home:

- `neural-lace/docs/plans/` — gitignored; plans there survive locally but aren't protected from `git clean`
- `~/.claude/plans/` — outside any git repo; plans there survive git operations anywhere but aren't version-controlled or shareable

Encountered 2026-04-22: wrote `harness-quick-wins-2026-04-22.md` to `neural-lace/docs/plans/`, hit the `.gitignore` at commit time, moved to `~/.claude/plans/` which is outside any repo.

Options to resolve:
- **Separate harness-dev repo:** e.g., `neural-lace-dev` or similar, tracking only the working plans/decisions/sessions for harness evolution. Isolates instance artifacts from shareable harness code.
- **Carve-out within neural-lace:** a `docs/internal-plans/` (not gitignored) specifically for harness-dev plans. Weakens the hygiene guarantee (contributors may leak identifiers), requires reviewer vigilance.
- **Accept `~/.claude/plans/`:** formalize this as THE location for harness-dev plans. Add a README there explaining the convention. Plans are local-only by design; cross-machine collaboration requires explicit git init + separate repo setup by the contributor.

Recommendation pending: option 3 (accept local-only) is cheapest and matches actual practice. Options 1-2 are correct for a growing contributor base.

### P2 — Bug-persistence gate should recognize cross-repo persistence

The `bug-persistence-gate.sh` hook scopes its check to the current project's `docs/backlog.md` or `docs/reviews/`. When trigger phrases reference harness-level concerns and persistence legitimately happens in the neural-lace repo, the hook still fires against the project cwd.

Two possible fixes:
- **Harness-aware scoping:** check both the current project's `docs/` AND `~/claude-projects/neural-lace/docs/backlog.md` when trigger phrases reference harness concerns (would require classifying trigger phrases as project-level vs harness-level)
- **Cross-repo persistence attestation:** explicit sentinel file (e.g., `.claude/state/persisted-elsewhere-<hash>.txt`) carrying the commit SHA of the cross-repo persistence; similar to the existing `--ack` pattern

Workaround pattern (used 2026-04-22): write a dated review file in the current project's `docs/reviews/` that points at the authoritative persistence location. Works but requires the agent to remember to do it.

### P2 — Pre-existing harness-mirror drift between `~/.claude/` and `adapters/claude-code/` (surfaced 2026-04-24)

While building the failure-mode catalog plan (`docs/plans/failure-mode-catalog.md`), the harness-maintenance diff loop surfaced 25 pre-existing files that DIFFER between `~/.claude/` and `adapters/claude-code/`, plus 4 files MISSING from the repo. The drift is unrelated to the catalog plan and was already present at branch base. Affected categories: 7 agents, 11 rules, 7 hooks/skills/templates. Until reconciled, the harness-maintenance diff loop produces a noisy baseline that masks new drift.

**Fix:** dedicated reconciliation pass — for each DIFFERS file, decide which side is canonical (the live `~/.claude/` typically reflects the most recent thinking) and re-mirror. For the 4 MISSING files (`templates/completion-report.md`, `templates/decision-log-entry.md`, `skills/pt-implement.md`, `skills/pt-test.md`), copy to the repo. Then the diff loop returns clean and any future drift is immediately visible.

### P2 — capture-codify: detect FM-NNN-cited-but-doesn't-exist (2026-04-23)

Surfaced during planning of `docs/plans/capture-codify-pr-template.md` Section 6 ("Observability gaps"). Currently when a PR's mechanism field selects answer form (a) "Existing catalog entry" and cites `FM-NNN`, neither the CI workflow nor the local pre-push hook checks whether `FM-NNN` actually exists in `docs/failure-modes.md` at PR open time. A typo (`FM-001` vs `FM-100`) or a stale citation slips through silently — the PR passes the validator but the cite is dangling.

**Proposal:** extend the validator library (`.github/scripts/validate-pr-template.sh`) to optionally cross-reference any `FM-\d+` substring in the (a) section against `docs/failure-modes.md` headings (`^## FM-\d+`). On miss, emit a soft warning (`[pr-template] WARN: cited FM-NNN not found in catalog`) without failing the check — reviewer responsibility for now, but the warning makes the gap visible. Hard-fail later if false-positive rate is low.

**Effort:** ~1 hour (single regex addition, self-test cases for hit/miss/no-cite). Existing validator structure makes this trivial.

### P2 — capture-codify: answer-form distribution telemetry (2026-04-23)

Surfaced during planning of `docs/plans/capture-codify-pr-template.md` Section 6. The mechanism field has three answer forms (a / b / c). Tracking the distribution over time would surface meaningful patterns: a sudden spike in (c) "no mechanism" answers signals discipline drift; a steady stream of (b) "new entry proposed" with no follow-up catalog growth signals a broken capture-codify cycle.

**Proposal:** extend `adapters/claude-code/scripts/audit-merged-prs.sh` to count (a/b/c) selections per PR and emit a distribution summary alongside the per-PR PASS/FAIL output. Optionally feed the counts into the weekly `/harness-review` skill's compliance section.

**Effort:** ~2 hours. The validator library already detects answer-form selection in `detect_answer_form()`; surfacing it from the audit script is a single counter loop.

### P2 — capture-codify: pre-commit atomicity gate for template ↔ validator edits (2026-04-23)

Surfaced during planning of `docs/plans/capture-codify-pr-template.md` Section 7 (failure-mode row "Accidental template-file edit"). The validator library expects specific section headings and placeholder text in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. If a maintainer edits the template (e.g., changes wording while editing nearby files) without updating the validator's regex constants, the validator silently breaks — the next PR after the edit fails CI unexpectedly with a confusing message.

**Proposal:** new pre-commit hook `template-validator-atomicity-gate.sh` that detects when `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` is staged AND `.github/scripts/validate-pr-template.sh` is NOT staged in the same commit; blocks with a stderr message naming the rule. Mirror of the existing `decisions-index-gate.sh` atomicity pattern.

**Effort:** ~3 hours. Existing atomicity gate (`decisions-index-gate.sh`) is a direct template; copy + adapt regex + write self-test.

## Existing entries

## ✅ DELIVERED 2026-04-20 — Mechanical enforcement of bug-persistence rule

Shipped in commit `0090d4b`: `hooks/bug-persistence-gate.sh` Stop hook wired into `settings.json.template`. Scans session transcript for trigger phrases, checks `docs/backlog.md` + `docs/reviews/` for persistence, blocks session end if bugs mentioned without being recorded. Attestation escape hatch via `.claude/state/bugs-attested-*.txt`. Documented in `docs/harness-architecture.md`.

## P1 — Consolidated findings rollup on session end

Related to the bug-persistence hook: a skill or helper that, at session end, reads all `docs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` files + recent git log for `docs/backlog.md` changes, and produces a single `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-session-summary.md` cataloging every finding + its disposition (fixed in commit X / deferred to backlog entry Y / invalid).

## P1 — Hardening of existing self-applied rules

Several rules in `~/.claude/rules/` are Pattern-level (no hook enforcement) and depend on agent discipline. Audit them for which ones are violated most often in practice, and propose Mechanism-level enforcement (hook / schema / assertion) for the top offenders. Candidates from observation:

- `planning.md`'s "Identifying a gap = writing a backlog entry, in the same response" — violated on 2026-04-20
- `orchestrator-pattern.md`'s "Main session dispatches, doesn't build directly" — violated when main session is tempted by small edits
- `testing.md`'s "E2E testing after system-boundary commit" — often skipped when under time pressure

## P0 — Stop hook for "narrate-and-wait" pattern (new 2026-04-21)

Counterpart to bug-persistence-gate: catch the pattern where the agent
completes a unit of work, narrates a summary, and implicitly stops
waiting for user confirmation. Specifically blocks session termination
when the last N assistant turns contain trigger phrases like "next up
is", "ready to continue", "want me to proceed", "after merge", "then
I'll" — indicating the agent has queued up work it could be doing now
but is pausing to announce.

Scope ~3 hrs: Stop hook script, transcript regex, allowlist for genuine
end-of-session summaries (e.g., "done for tonight", explicit /clear
requests, explicit "stop" from user).

This was added after the maintainer repeatedly observed the agent
stopping mid-execution on 2026-04-21 and asking rhetorical "are you
still working?" questions.
